# Modern ToDo CRUD App (Vite + React)

I created this React ToDo app that saves and loads to local storage. The React App includes full CRUD functionality: create, read, update, and delete. 
It's also customised with Light/Dark Mode and a Color Theme switcher.

## Main Learning Points:

* Building Components in React.
* Passing Props between Components.
* Creating your own Custom Hooks to read and write data to your local storage.
* How to deal with State locally and pass it between Components.
* Working with Heroicons (Beautiful hand-crafted SVG icons, by the makers of Tailwind CSS).
* Accessibility (aria-label, color theme switcher).
* Working with Vite JS, for a faster and smoother development workflow. It immediately updates your changes in the browser. 
* Customised App by adding Light/Dark Mode.
* Customised App by adding color theme switcher.
